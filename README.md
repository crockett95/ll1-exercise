Lunch and Learn 1: Git & Tools
===

This is the example repository for the Planview WCS team to take a look at learning some Git basics.

Questions for thought
---

1. Do you see how the commits that you made are divided by what you were doing? (These were pretty small but they give you an idea)
2. Take a look at the commits before and after you reverted the CSS changes. Did you see how by keeping your commits small and related, you can easily undo something that you did, even if it spans multiple files?
3. Does the Git-flow process make sense to you? Why or why not?
4. Do you need to have a remote repository, or even be connected to the internet, to use Git? Why or why not?
5. What doesn't make sense to you about this?
